## introduction
According to my internship programme at Internsify Africa, I was expected to build an interactive dashboard and gain valuable insights into the analysis of Bank credit to private sectors in Nigeria. 
This project centres on how credits are allocated to the various sector and subsector in  Nigeria from 2015 to 2020.

## about the dataset
The dataset consists of 378 Rows and 6 columns
named the Quater, Year, Sector, Sub-sector, Amount and Values.
The dataset shows the amount of money in naira and the number of values allocated to the different Sectors and sub-sectors in Nigeria.
The dataset also shows the amount of credit that was given to each sector and sub-sector quarterly and yearly  from 2015 to 2020.

## tools used 
Excel, to clean the dataset 
JupyterLab (python) for Explorary analysis and visualization 
PowerBI, to build an insightful and interactive dashboard.

## aim
To come up with an intuitive, insightful and interactive dashboard.
Do an Exploratory Data Analysis and insightful visualizations with the dataset using Jupyter Lab(python).

## data cleaning and transformation 
Understanding the dataset gave more ideas on how to arrange or clean the dataset for accurate analysis.
The dataset was effectively cleaned and transformed using Excel. 
some of the steps are listed below;
.transposing the dataset using power query
.easily replacing cells in a column in power query
.using vlookup function to avoid inappropriate values.

## methodology
.Domain knowledge acquisition
.Genearating the aim of the project
.Data transformation and cleaning 
.Building insightful and interactive dashboard 
.Gaining insights from the dashboard.

## analysis and visualization









According to the dashboard, here are the following observations 
.From 2015 to 20220, the service sector received major credits followed by the government sector
.A significant amount of credit was allocated to the oil and gas under the sub-sector followed by the manufacturing sub-sector, whereas the education and minning and querying sub-sector received a minor of the credit.
